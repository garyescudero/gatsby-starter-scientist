  Producing functional neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells in a consistent
  and high throughput manner remains challenging. We develop bioactive scaffolds
  for directing stem cell differentiation using both physical and chemical cues.
  My research group has developed many types of biomaterial scaffolds, including
  fibrin hydrogels, multifunctional nanofibers, functionalized microfibers, and
  microspheres that provide controlled release of proteins and small molecules,
  for promoting the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into neural
  phenotypes. Our recent work has focused on using 3D printing as tool for
  engineering personalized neural tissue models of disease.. More details on
  this work can be found at the Research and Publications links. More

  We have also fabricated novel microspheres to deliver small molecules in a
  controlled fashion. As their name implies, microspheres are spherical
  particles with diameters in the micrometer range and these particles can be
  produced from natural or synthetic materials. The major benefit of using
  microspheres is that they can deliver bioactive drugs over a variety of time
  courses depending on the fabrication conditions of the microspheres. We
  developed a novel method for engineering neural tissue by combining retinoic
  acid releasing microspheres into aggregates of human iPSCs, where they
  promoted neuronal differentiation. Dr. Willerth was recognized as a Young
  Innovator in 2015, based in part on the work published in Cellular and
  Molecular Bioengineering. On-going work by the group involves characterization
  of microspheres that deliver the small molecules purmorphamine and
  guggulsterone â€“ both of which promote neuronal differentiation of hiPSCs. We
  will demonstrate how different combinations and concentrations of these
  drug-releasing microspheres can be used to engineer different types of neural
  tissue.
